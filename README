Parameters:

  <file-or-dir>          path to file or directory

Options:

  -h, --help             show this output
  -v, --version          show version information

Configuration:

  .niche.jdn             configuration file

Examples:

  Create and run tests in `src/` directory:

  $ niche src

  `niche` can be used via `jpm`, `jeep`, etc. with
  some one-time setup.  Create a suitable `.niche.jdn`
  file in a project's root directory and a runner
  file in a project's `test/` subdirectory (see below
  for further details).

  Run via `jeep test`:

  $ jeep test

  Run via `jpm test`:

  $ jpm test

  Run using the configuration file via direct
  invocation:

  $ niche

Example `.niche.jdn` content:

  {# what to work on - file and dir paths
   :includes ["src" "bin/my-script"]
   # what to skip - file paths only
   :excludes ["src/sample.janet"]}

Example runner file `test/trigger-niche.janet`:

  (import ../niche)

  (niche/main)
