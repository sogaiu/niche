Usage: niche [<file-or-dir>...]
       niche [-h|--help] [-v|--version]

Nimbly Interpret Comment-Hidden Expressions

Parameters:

  <file-or-dir>          path to file or directory

Options:

  -h, --help             show this output
  -v, --version          show version information

Configuration:

  .niche.jdn             configuration file

Example uses:

  1. Create and run comment-hidden expression tests
     in `src/` directory:

     $ niche src

  2. A configuration file (`.niche.jdn`) can be used
     to specify paths to operate on and avoid
     spelling out paths at the command line:

     $ niche

  3. `niche` can be used via `jeep`, `jpm`, etc.
     with some one-time setup.  In a project's root
     directory, create a suitable `.niche.jdn` file
     and a runner file in the project's `test/`
     subdirectory (see below for further details).
     Then, in the case of `jeep`:

     $ jeep test

Example `.niche.jdn` configuration file:

  {# what to work on - file and dir paths
   :includes ["src" "bin/my-script"]
   # what to skip - file paths only
   :excludes ["src/sample.janet"]}

Example runner file `test/trigger-niche.janet`:

  # adjust the path as needed
  (import ../niche) # niche.janet is in project root

  (niche/main)
